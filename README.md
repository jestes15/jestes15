### Hi there 👋

- I am currently working as an Electrical Engineer at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, D.C.
- In my spare time, I build embedded systems, preferably SMT32 based systems, and write the firmware for these systems.
- 📫 If you want to talk about a project, email me @ 3553.0107.6643.934sin@gmail.com and I'll be happy to talk!
